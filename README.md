# Function-approximation-with-the-help-of-genetic-programming
(GP) AI project
Description:
One of the issues raised in mathematical sciences and engineering is function approximation. Function approximation means having the ability to calculate
To approximate the value of an unknown function at arbitrary points, the mathematical rule of said function. In this project to approximate the function
Genetic programming (GP - Genetic Programming) is used.
the project goal :
Evaluating the level of mastery of the basic concepts of evolutionary algorithms (here genetic programming)
